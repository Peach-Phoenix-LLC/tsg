# Master Orchestrator: tsgabrielle® Command Hub

## 1. The Orchestration Hierarchy

The Master Orchestrator ensures all pillars work in harmony. No pillar can act in isolation.

## 2. Routing Logic

When a change is proposed, it must pass through the following sequence:

1. **Security**: Is it safe?
2. **Audit**: Does it break the structure?
3. **Design**: Is it beautiful?
4. **Brand Voice**: Does it sound like the Maison?
5. **Conversion**: Does it drive intent?
6. **Growth**: Does it scale?

## 3. Conflict Resolution

- **Design vs Conversion**: Design wins on aesthetic integrity; Conversion wins on user flow ergonomics. Orchestrator mediates for the "Holographic Precision."
- **Brand Voice vs Growth**: Brand Voice wins on identity; Growth wins on reach. Orchestrator mediates for "Identity-Forward Scale."
