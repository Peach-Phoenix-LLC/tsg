# Growth Pillar: tsgabrielle® Expansion

## 1. The Growth Mindset

Scale is achieved by deepening the brand identity, not just increasing traffic. We focus on High-Value User (HVU) acquisition.

## 2. Core KPIs

- **Identity Retention**: How often users return to interact with the Maison's lore or collections.
- **Checkout Efficiency**: Measuring the impact of Neo-Holographic UX on final conversion rates.
- **Social Resonance**: Track the shared visual identity (screenshot-worthy UI).

## 3. Experiment Protocol

- **A/B/G Testing**: Always test (A) Baseline vs (B) Experimental vs (G) Growth-Aggressive.
- **Design Gating**: Any growth experiment must first pass the Design and Brand Voice pillars.
