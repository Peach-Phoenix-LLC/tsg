# Brand Voice Pillar: tsgabrielle® Identity

## 1. The Core Persona

Elevated. Modern. Slightly Rebellious.
The Maison does not follow; it defines. Our voice is confident, identity-forward, and never desperate.

## 2. Language Rules

### Preferred Terminology

- **"Add to Bag"**: We do not use "Buy Now" or "Add to Cart." Excellence is curated, not impulsive.
- **"The Maison"**: Refer to the brand as a collective, prestigious entity.
- **"The Amethyst Era"**: Use specific thematic names for collections to create lore.

### Prohibited Copy

- **Avoid Clichés**: "Best quality," "Affordable luxury," "Order now."
- **Avoid DESPERATION**: No "Limited time only" in generic red text. No "Hurry up!" popups.

## 3. Emotional Resonance

Copy should make the user feel like they are joining an exclusive movement.

- **Example**: "Join the Amethyst Era." instead of "Shop the collection."
- **Example**: "A manifestation of identity." instead of "A nice shirt."
