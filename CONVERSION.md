# Conversion Pillar: tsgabrielle® Funnel Logic

## 1. Scarcity & Social Proof

Scarcity in the Maison is subtle and premium. We use **Brand Yellow** (`#fef08a`) to highlight availability without breaking the dark aesthetic.

## 2. The Conversion Path

### Scarcity Indicators

- **High-Vis Accents**: Used only for low-stock warnings or final order confirmations.
- **Bespoke Messaging**: "Reserved for the Amethyst Era" implies limited production.

### Checkout Flow

- **Frictionless Transition**: Use holographic gradients to guide the eye toward the PayPal button.
- **Trust Reinforcement**: Display "Secured by the Maison Security Protocol" at the final step.

## 3. Optimization Rules

- **No Intrusive Modals**: Conversion is earned through desire, not disruption.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: The product image is always the hero; the price and CTA are elegant supporting actors.
